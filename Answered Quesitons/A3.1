- Camera, creates the viewpoint and pov for an object, different types of cmaera, THREE.PerspectiveCamera, THREE.OrthographicCamera, or THREE.CombinedCamera these are available to create suitable camera for a 3D object.
- Geometry, defines the necessary geometry for three js to create shapes for objects and so on. THREE.Geometry or THREE.BufferGeometry classes are there to do it.
- Mesh, a combined form of geometry and material for an object, creation of an instance of mesh is done by THREE.Mesh, then adding to the scene is possible.
- Lights, used to illuminate different types of effects and appearance for objects. THREE.PointLight, THREE.DirectionalLight, or THREE.AmbientLight are some ways to do it.
