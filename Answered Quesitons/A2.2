Purpose of bpy module:
In general what I understood so far, bpy gives access to control all the blender functionalities using python. bpy gives a wide range of functionalities like object manipulation (setting properties for any objects and their creation, location, rotation, scale, operations like parenting, duplicating, linking); mesh editing (mesh basically defines the vertices, edges, and faces of any objects, bpy helps to define those and manipulate those); animation keyframing, rendering, output scene and data access these all are  controlled by bpy blender module of python.

code snippet for transformation of an object:

# import necessary packages to control blender functionalities
import bpy
import math

# transformation manipulation
obj = bpy.context.scene.objects["Suzanne"]
obj.location.z += 1
obj.scale.z += 1
obj.rotation_euler.z += math.pi

In this snippet,
- first I got the context of the object by catching the name of the object as "Suzanne"
- Then by using the obj.location.z and +=1, the object location get increased in the z axis and after running each time the script, the object basically moves 1 space up every time.
- then by using the scale method, the object gets sclaed up for 1 space
- after that rotation_euler used the math.pi to rotate 180 degree having z as the axis of the rotation.

In this way different transformation methods usde for different types of manipulation of any blender object.
